# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to understand trends and patterns. It includes various stages such as data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, categorical analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that the following requirements are met:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn missingno category_encoders imbalanced-learn xgboost shap
```
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv.

## Downloading the Dataset
After unzipping the file you can see the dataset that has been used in the project. Can give the path of the unzipped dataset or Can Download the dataset from the following link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data
Save the dataset to a known directory on your local machine.


## Configuring the Dataset Path
Update the file_path variable in the script to the location where you have saved the dataset. For example:
file_path = '/path/to/your/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv'


## Usage
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The script starts with loading the data and includes functions for handling missing values and preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualization and analysis of the data to uncover insights.

Categorical Analysis and Encoding: Handles categorical data and demonstrates how to encode it.

Feature Engineering: Demonstrates techniques for feature engineering.

Modeling: Includes implementation of different machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation and Tuning: Evaluates the performance of the models and includes hyperparameter tuning.

SHAP Analysis: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the model.

Prediction Results Analysis: Analyzes the predictions made by the models.

## Running the Code
The code is structured in a sequential manner. You can run it in a Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to understand each part of the project.
